# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithm Practices (Lab Exercise)
This repository contains my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) lab practice exercises. The topics include structures and arrays, array matrices, linked lists, circular linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, min-max heaps, and B-trees. All folders, source code, and lab questions are organized neatly by topic for easy reference and learning.

## 🛠️ Technologies
* C++
* Visual Studio Code

## ✨ Features
Here’s what you can do with Data Structures & Algorithm Practices (Lab Exercise):
* Run individual source code files to test and observe different data structures and algorithms.
* Compare how different structures work and behave in various situations.
* Use the organized folders to study concepts topic-by-topic.
* Explore real lab-style DSA problem implementations.

## 📝 The Process
These exercises were developed based on my lab questions and practice tasks. For many topics such as stacks, queues, and binary trees, I used pen-and-paper tracing to follow the step-by-step output and verify that the logic worked correctly before finalizing the implementation.

This process helped me better understand how values move through each structure and how operations such as insert, delete, push, pop, and traversal behave internally.

## 🎓 What I Learned
### 🧩 Core Data Structure Foundations
* Gained hands-on experience working with arrays, matrices, and structured data.
* Learned how linked lists and circular linked lists store and connect data dynamically.

### 🧠 Algorithmic Thinking
* Practiced tracing logic step-by-step to understand how outputs are generated.
* Improved understanding of how stack and queue operations work behind the scenes.

### 🌳 Tree & Heap Concepts
* Learned how binary trees, heaps, and B-trees are structured and traversed.
* Understood basic insertion and organization rules for hierarchical data.

### 🎓 Student Perspective
* I explored and practiced these concepts as part of my learning journey — not as an expert, but as a student building a strong foundation and confidence in DSA.

## 🚀 How Can It Be Improved?
* Implement these data structures in real-world mini-projects or applications.
* Add visualization tools or diagrams to show how operations change structure states.
* Convert some exercises into reusable C++ classes or modules.
* Expand the repository with sorting, searching, and graph algorithms in the future.

## 🖥️ Running the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open any source code file in your preferred C++ IDE (Visual Studio Code, Dev-C++, etc.).
3. Compile and run the program for the specific data structure you want to test.
4. Repeat the process for other folders to explore each topic.
