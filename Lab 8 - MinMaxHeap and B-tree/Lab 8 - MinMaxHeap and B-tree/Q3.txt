Common Problems Solved Using Binary Search Trees (BST)
=======================================================

1. Dynamic Set Operations
   - Insertion and deletion of elements while maintaining sorted order.
   - Efficient searching for specific keys.
   - Supports operations like finding predecessor/successor, minimum, and maximum.

2. Sorted Data Storage
   - Maintaining data that is automatically kept in sorted order.
   - Implementing ordered dictionaries, maps, and sets.

3. Range Queries
   - Finding and listing all keys between two given values.
   - Used in interval queries and range searches.

4. Associative Array/Dictionary Implementations
   - BSTs are often used to implement dictionary data structures that allow fast lookup,
     update, and removal operations.

5. Order-Statistic Problems
   - With augmentations, BSTs can compute the rank of an element (i.e., its position in sorted order).
   - Efficiently select the kth smallest or largest element.

6. In-Memory Databases
   - Applications requiring dynamic queries with in-order traversal are well-suited for BSTs.

7. Cache Implementations & Searching
   - BSTs can be used in caching systems where quick insertions and retrievals are required,
     especially in scenarios where data is subject to frequent updates.

8. Other Applications
   - Autocomplete systems where keys are managed in an ordered fashion.
   - Sorted data traversal, which is beneficial in algorithms that require ordered processing.
